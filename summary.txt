The paper focuses on highlighting an algorithm called AlphaZero which is used to make a computer agent learn how to play chess , shogi and Go using only self play and without feeding in the knowledge about the environment of each individual game. He wanted to not only understand the intelligence of a human but also mimic its behaviour in a computer agent. Although the paper shows experimental based evidence to claim the generalization of the algorithm for playing games but all the games under experimentation were two player games whereas the hypothesis claims that it has the ability to learn and adapt to multiple player  games.
